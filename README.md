# 👋 Hi there, I'm Emil COZMA

🚀 Cybersecurity Analyst | Threat Detection & Response | AI-Enhanced Security Tools

With over a decade of experience in software engineering and a recent pivot into cybersecurity, I'm passionate about protecting systems, users, and businesses from digital threats. I hold the [**Google Cybersecurity Certificate**](https://www.credly.com/badges/845b4066-9a99-43d5-9694-12478433de1e/linked_in_profile) and build tools that make the web safer - from AI-enhanced vulnerability scanners to scam detection platforms.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🛡️ **Threat Detection & Vulnerability Management**  
  I specialize in identifying and analyzing threats across networks, web applications, and systems. I use tools like Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nmap, and OpenVAS to perform vulnerability assessments and baseline hardening.

- ⚙️ **Security Automation & Tooling**  
  I develop Python and Bash based scripts to automate scanning, alerting, and reporting - reducing manual effort and speeding up incident response.

- 🔍 **Monitoring & Analysis**  
  I analyze logs and events (e.g., using ELK stack, Fail2Ban, custom log parsers) to detect patterns and potential intrusions.

- 🧠 **AI for Cyber Defense**  
  I'm currently developing [**NeuraShift**](https://getneurashift.com)  - AI Integration for Small Business, [**Scanwise**](https://scanwise.app)  - an AI-powered web vulnerability scanner, and [**JobScamFinder**](https://jobscamfinder.com) - a tool to identify fake job postings online.

- ☁️ **Secure DevOps**  
  Experience with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and hardening servers (Linux/BSD) for production.
